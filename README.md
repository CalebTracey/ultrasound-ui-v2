# ultrasound-ui-v2

This is the user interface for the ultrasound application I developed. See the backend code here: [ultrasound-api-v2](https://github.com/CalebTracey/ultrasound-api-v2)

*This is not production code - development is done in a private GitLab repo and deployed through CI*

The app serves as a way to view and organize a large library of ultrasound clips. This provides a way to easily access and search for the desired clips for education purposes.

I learned a lot about full stack development while creating this app. I gained a much better understanding of frontend/backend interaction, security, and state management.

Recently I have been working mainly with Go. This led me to take the less conventional route of serving the static content through a Go server rather than a more obvious choice such as nginx.

The main technologies used are react, golang, redux-toolkit, bootstrap, sass, and JWT.
